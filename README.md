# Lung_Cancer_Project
This was my final project and I hope to Integrate biomarker data with imaging data to better enhance the early detection of lung cancer

Please note that this is a jupyter file and it may download some packages when ran. Also I used datasets from TCIA_LIDC-IDRA and NSCLC-Radiomics but I had to reduce these datasets due to resource draining when training.
